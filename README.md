# US_mapping
US Covid Choropleth - learning edition

What is this project about?
It is multi-purposed. On the face of it, it is meant to be a tool for visualizing some data.
While I would like to see some of that come to fruition, it is also a bit of a quarantine project.
For myself, and possibly for others. Maybe you are bored and want to learn how to make these kinds of things.
Maybe you are curious about what the numbers look like in your neighboorhood.
Maybe you are taking a data science class and your teacher tells you to use python but doesn't teach it to you and you
are trying to figure out how to set up a python environment. Maybe you are trying to learn how to use version control
with github and want to try forking a repo or making a pull request or any number of things related to this. 

Trying to get project uploaded from pycharm, so far just an empty repository on github,
can't seem to find anything to actually get the files from pycharm on my computer to my github account.
Would like to know what's up with that.
