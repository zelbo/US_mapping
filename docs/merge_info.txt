County merge data: STATE_FP, COUNTY_FP, COUNTY, FIPS, COUNTY_NAME, STUSPS
County election results: STATE_NAME, STUSPS, COUNTY_NAME, FIPS, PARTY
Covid 19 Cases by County: fips (odd format: 1001.0), state (name), county (name)

State merge data: STATE_FP, STUSPS, STATE_NAME, STATENS
State election results: STATE_FP, STUSPS, STATE_NAME, STATENS, PARTY
COVID 19 Cases by State: State (name)

Naming conventions could use some work.
Create constants for the headings?
Should FIPS be treated as an int or a string?
Will the mismatch between 1001.0 and 01001 be an issue? Convert? Ignore?
Do we even need the glue data for this project?

Merge Steps:
    glue_data + election_results = political.csv
    + covid_data = covid_political.csv
    + geo_shape = debug.csv (good luck opening this in a spreadsheet program)
